# GP Decaf

This is a list of places in Greenpoint, Brooklyn that I can personally attest have decaf. I specify whether they have decaf espresso, brew, or both. We also may provide a mini review of the decaf.

If you want to add to this list, [open a PR!](https://github.com/mathslug/gpdecaf.info/tree/main).

# Peter Pan

Brew Decaf here is cheap (under $2) and good. It's good, extremely down-the-middle American morning Joe.

# Paloma

Decaf espresso only. The highest quality decaf espresso drinks, artisan beans.

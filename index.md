# GP Decaf

This is a list of places in Greenpoint, Brooklyn where we can personally attest that decaf coffee is available. We specify whether they have decaf espresso, brew, or both. We also may provide a mini review of the decaf.

## Peter Pan

Brew decaf here is cheap (under $2) and good. It's solid, extremely down-the-middle American morning Joe.

## Paloma

Decaf espresso only. The highest quality decaf espresso drinks made from artisan beans.

## Three Decker Diner

They usually do not have decaf, but sometimes one may get lucky and find they have a pot on. The decaf tends to be a little gritty-tasting.

## Odd Fox

Decaf espresso available. I had a decaf cortado that was yummy. It had a nutty flavor with just a hint of sour. I have been conditioned to identify this taste as "good coffee taste".

## Caf√© Mogador

Technically in Williamsburg, this spacious Moroccan spot serves somewhat watery decaf espresso.

# GP Decaf

This is a list of places in Greenpoint, Brooklyn where we can personally attest that decaf coffee is available. We specify whether they have decaf espresso, brew, or both. We also may provide a mini review of the decaf.

If you want to add to this list, [open a PR!](https://github.com/mathslug/gpdecaf.info/)

## Peter Pan

Brew Decaf here is cheap (under $2) and good. It's solid, extremely down-the-middle American morning Joe.

## Paloma

Decaf espresso only. The highest quality decaf espresso drinks made from artisan beans.

### Three Decker Diner

They usually do not have decaf, but sometimes one may get lucky and find they have a pot on. The decaf tends to be a little gritty-tasting.
